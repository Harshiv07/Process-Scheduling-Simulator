### Requirements : 
-> Netbeans IDE 8.2 or above
-> JDK 12.0.2
-> JRE 8

In Netbeans, you need to install certain libraries :
-> JAVA swing library
-> JAVA FX
-> Import Absolute Layout Library: You must click on libraries in the NetBeans project panel and add a library. Select Absolute Layout Library

### Algorithms Implemented: 
-> First Come First Serve Algorithm (FCFS)
-> Round Robin Algorithm (RR)
-> Shortest Job First Algorithm (SJF)

#### Input Parameters: Arrival Time and Burst Time
#### Output Parameters: Average Turn Around Time, Average Waiting Time, Turn Around Time of Each Process and Waiting Time of each process  

Note: In some cases, we get waiting time as -1, indicating that this is not an idle case and that the CPU remained unutilized in that period.

### LIMITATIONS 
-> We need to take the arrival time of the first process 0, or it does not result in a successful simulation.

### RESULTS:
Run the executable .jar file to run the application if you have Java installed. We have added screenshots to provide an overview of the application.
